APIs act as the \u0026ldquo;front door\u0026rdquo; for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services. Using API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs, HTTP APIs, or WebSocket APIs (which enable real-time two-way communication applications). API Gateway supports containerized and serverless workloads, as well as web applications.\nAPI Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, CORS support, authorization and access control, throttling, monitoring, and API version management. API Gateway has no minimum fees or startup costs. You pay for the API calls you receive and the amount of data transferred out and, with the API Gateway tiered pricing model, you can reduce your cost as your API usage scales. In the main lab sections, you will create an API that invokes a lambda function to calculate the price of a house (price per square foot). In the first part of the lab, you will deploy a pre-defined sample lambda function and create the back-end API. You will test your APIs using both the API Gateway console and Postman.\nIn the optional lab sections, you will learn how to cache service responses, throttle requests, and create various usage plans.\nThe overall architecture for the lab is depicted above.\nConfigure your own API Gateway by going through the labs in the order below:\nPre-Requisites and Lambda Deployment Create Your First API Message Transformation Request Validation Authentication and Authorization API Deployment Message Caching (Optional) Usage Plans and Message Throttling (Optional) Clean Up Resources "

In each CIDR subnet block, the first 4 IP addresses and the last IP addresses are not available to users and cannot be assigned to instances.

	"description": "",
	"content": " Automated Scaling Lab Architecture: Below is a diagram of our end state architecture. Please build! There are three main components to EC2 Auto Scaling on AWS Launch Template: A Launch Template is a feature of EC2 Auto Scaling that allows a way to templatize your launch requests. It enables you to store launch parameters so that you do not have to specify them every time you launch an instance. For example, a launch template can contain a specific Amazon Machine Image, instance type, storage, and networking settings that you typically use to launch instances. For each Launch Template, you can create one or more numbered Launch Template Versions. Each version can have different launch parameters.\n2. Auto Scaling Groups: For auto scaling your EC2 instances are organized into groups so that they can be treated as a logical unit for the purposes of scaling and management. When you create a group, you can specify its minimum, maximum, and desired number of EC2 instances.\nScaling Policies: A Scaling Policy tells Auto Scaling when and how to scale. Scaling can occur manually, on a schedule, on demand, or you can use Auto Scaling to maintain a specific number of instances.\nAuto Scaling is well suited for applications that have unpredictable demand patterns that can experience hourly, daily, or weekly variability in usage. This helps you to manage your cost and eliminate over-provisioning of capacity during times when it is not needed. Auto Scaling can also find an unhealthy instance, terminate that instance, and launch a new one based on the scaling plan.\nThe number of EC2 instances can be scaled in or out as Auto Scaling responds to the metrics you define when creating these groups.\nYou can specify the minimum number of instances in each Auto Scaling Group, so that your group never goes below this size. (Even if the instances are determined to be unhealthy) You can specify the maximum number of instances in each Auto Scaling Group, so that your group never goes above this size. You can specify a desired capacity to specify the number of healthy instances your auto scaling group should have at all times. (More information can be found here) You can specify scaling policies so that Auto Scaling will modify the desired target capacity mentioned in the previous point. It will launch or terminate instances as demand on your application increases or decreases. Create a launch template When you create an Auto Scaling Group, you must specify a Launch Template. The first step in this lab is to create a Launch Template for an EC2 Auto Scaling Pool.\nNavigate to Amazon EC2\nFind \u0026ldquo;Instance\u0026rdquo; and select Launch Template. Create a launch template. Start with \u0026ldquo;Launch Template Name and Description\u0026rdquo;:\nLaunch Template Name: [Your Initials]-scaling-template Sample version description: This is optional Auto Scaling Instructions : Check the box to provide instructions \u0026ldquo;Launch Sample Content\u0026rdquo; defines the parameters for instances in the Auto Scaling group: Amazon Machine Image (AMI) : Select \u0026ldquo;My AMI\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Owned by Me\u0026rdquo;. In the search drop down by entering your initials and select the custom AMI you just created [Your initials]_Auto_Scaling_WebHost . (The new AMI you just created may already be selected) Instance type: t2.micro Key Pair (Login) : Select the Key Pair you generated in the first lab, most likely it\u0026rsquo;s [Your initials]-KeyPair Network settings : Subnet: Not included in the launch template Firewall (security groups): Select \u0026ldquo;Select an existing security group\u0026rdquo; and then select the security group you created in the first part of this lab called [Abbreviated name of you] - Auto Scaling SG Configure Storage : Leave Default Resource tags : None Advanced Details : IMPORTANT : Select the arrow to expand \u0026ldquo;Advanced Details\u0026rdquo; and under \u0026ldquo;Detailed Cloudwatch Monitoring\u0026rdquo; select Enable. Leave everything else as default. When you are sure that the configurations are correct, click Create Launch Template, then click View Launch Template. You are now done creating your Launch Template.
